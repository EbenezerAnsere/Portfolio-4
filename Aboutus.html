    <h3>About us</h3>

        In the past, I thought that how the technology was made to help people to use and many people like the technologies like computers, mobile phone and others. I found out that there are software engineers, software developers, designers, programmers create
        many applications in the computers to process, behave and perform. I realize that the technology was released by among top skillful teams or individuals.

        I started interesting in learning the technologies especially software. But i should have knowledge of the hardware and software before i could learn software development using programming languages which include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Bootstrap,
        etc.
